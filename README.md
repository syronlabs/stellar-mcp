## ⚙️ Configuration

### 🔑 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following configuration:

```env
STELLAR_SERVER_URL=
```

### 🔧 Configuration to use Stellar MCP Server

Here's the configuration to use the Stellar MCP server on Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop:

#### 💻 Local
    
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
      "stellar-mcp": {
        "command": "node",
        "args": ["your/path/stellar-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```
#### 📦 NPX

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
      "stellar-mcp": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "stellar-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```


#### 🐳 Docker

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stellar": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "--init",
        "-e",
        "STELLAR_SERVER_URL=<STELLAR_URL_VALUE>",
        "stellar-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 📥 Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### 🔨 Build

```bash
npm run build
```

### 🚀 Run

Development:
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Production:
```bash
npm run start:prod
```

## 📚 Basic Example Usage 

[Video TBD]

## 🔍 Debugging with MCP Inspector

To debug the Stellar MCP server and monitor all interactions between the LLM and the Stellar network, you can use the MCP Inspector. This tool provides a real-time view of all requests and responses.

### Running with MCP Inspector

Use the following command to start the server with the inspector:

```bash
npm run start:prod
```

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node <your/path>/stellar-mcp npm run start:prod
```

This will start the MCP Inspector on port 9229. You can then open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5173
```

The inspector will show you:
- All incoming requests from the LLM
- Outgoing responses and errors
- Real-time Stellar network interactions
- Detailed transaction information

This is particularly useful when:
- Debugging Stellar interactions
- Monitoring transaction flows
- Troubleshooting failed operations
- Understanding the sequence of API calls
